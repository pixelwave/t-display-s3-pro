T-Display-S3-Pro sample project for troubleshooting.

Current issue that the touchscreen does not work reliably when using battery mode. Only when attached to USB cable / power.

You can try my sample code yourself with the following test setups:

1) Power Switch "OFF", connected and powered from USB port (PC/Laptop)
2) Power Switch "ON" battery powered only
   
In scenario 1) the touch inputs work reliably and 99% of the time. In Scenario 2) the touch is a hit and miss. Sometimes the buttons work sometimes not.

So in summary I assume a general hardware issue with the board design and how the battery is connected (GND issue?). I hope this can be resolved in an updated version (I have V1.1) because otherwise the product is quite awesome! But with that flaw currently unusable im battery mode.
